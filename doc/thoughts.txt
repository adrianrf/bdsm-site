Thoughts:

1. Why? What's the pain point/frustration this solves?
  a. Gimme a logline: Like "Top Gun with fanboats". 
    i. Is it rack for server maintenance? or RVM on steroids?
    ii. Is it more for development, system administration, or deployment?
    iii. What's the benefit of writing extensions for it vs. a gem, etc.?
    
2. Most devs don't typically write gems, they are consumers. Who are the consumers here? What's the benefit?
