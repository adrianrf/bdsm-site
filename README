== Bash Development and Scripting Management (BDSM) Framework Documentation WebSite

You can see the documentation live online at http://bdsm.beginrescueend.com/.

== Get the Site Running Locally

If you're going to help you'll first need to get the site running locally.
Start by forking the repository and cloning the fork.

== Requirements

The site requires that you have ruby 1.9.2 running in your environment.
(Although you can manually use something else, this is what is setup in the
.rvmrc file currently.)

You can do this with RVM (https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install,
http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/basics/) by typing the following at the
command line:

rvm install 1.9.2

bdsm-site requires a few gems that can be found in bdsm-site.gems, including:

  Compass
  http://compass-style.org/

  HAML (SASS is bundled with this Gem)
  http://haml-lang.com/
  http://sass-lang.com/

  Nanoc3
  http://nanoc.stoneship.org/

  Rack
  http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_on_rack.html

  Mime-type
  http://rubyforge.org/projects/mime-types/

The cloned site will detect if you have these installed (except Mime-type) in
your current ruby and if not it will install them in RVM for you.

== Getting it Running

If you are in RVM and have 1.9.2 already running, simply clone this repository
and cd to the directory.  The project .rvmrc will be loaded and you can open in
your editor and start hacking away.

If you would like to view the changes locally as you hack,
You can use Nanoc's AutoCompile feature:

	nanoc3 aco

== Update Submission

Once you are satisfied with your changes to the documentation push it back to
your github fork and initiate a pull request. Please use topic branches.

== Thanks

Thank you for taking the time to work on the BDSM website!!!
