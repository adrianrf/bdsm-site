%h1
  BDSM Configuration
%p
  BDSM's configuration directory is located at $bdsm_config_path, which for a
  typical installation will be located in your $HOME directory, at
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ~/.bdsm/config/
%h2
  Defaults
%p
  BDSM's shipping defaults are stored in the file
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $bdsm_path/config/db
%p
  Note: this file is replaced each time you upgrade bdsm, so do not edit it! If you need to, override it instead.

%h2
  Overriding Default Settings
%p
  To override bdsm's default settings, simply add appropriate key=value entry pairs into the file
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $bdsm_path/config/user
%p
  bdsm will then use these settings, instead of the built-in defaults.
