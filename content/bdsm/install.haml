%h1 Installing BDSM

%p
  You may install either the latest release version of BDSM; or you can choose the latest up-to-the-minute development snapshots as they come, by summoning git HEAD.

%h2
  Latest Release

%p
  To install the latest BDSM release, run the following commands in
  your shell:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    mkdir -p /usr/local/src &&
    cd /usr/local/src &&
    version=$(curl https://bdsm.beginrescueend.com/releases/latest.txt) &&
    curl -O https://bdsm.beginrescueend.com/releases/bdsm-${version}.tar.bz2 &&
    tar jxf bdsm-${version}.tar.bz2 &&
    cd bdsm-${version} &&
    ./install

%p
  Note: you can skip the first two lines if you prefer to install from your
  current directory.
%p
  The bdsm binary will be located in /usr/local/bin, and bdsm itself will be
  located in /usr/local/bdsm.
%p
  If you do not already have /usr/local/bin in your path, add it in /etc/profile
%pre.code
  :preserve
    PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin" ; export PATH

%h2
  Latest Development Snapshot (git HEAD)
%p
  For the latest BDSM development, "live" (git HEAD):
%pre.code
  :preserve
    mkdir -p /usr/local/src &&
    cd /usr/local/src &&
    git clone git://github.com/wayneeseguin/bdsm.git &&
    cd bdsm &&
    ./install
