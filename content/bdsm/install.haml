  There are two ways to install BDSM.

  To install the latest BDSM framework release, run the following commands in
  your shell:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    mkdir -p /usr/local/src &&
    cd /usr/local/src &&
    version=$(curl https://bdsm.beginrescueend.com/releases/latest.txt) &&
    curl -O https://bdsm.beginrescueend.com/releases/bdsm-${version}.tar.bz2 &&
    tar jxf bdsm-${version}.tar.bz2 &&
    cd bdsm-${version} &&
    ./install

%p
  Note that the first two lines can be omitted if you want to install from your
  current directory.

  The bdsm binary will be located in /usr/local/bin and bdsm itself will be
  located in /usr/local/bdsm.

  If you do not already have /usr/local/bin in your path, add it in /etc/profile
