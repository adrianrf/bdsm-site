%h1 Contributing to BDSM

%p
  So, you want to contribute to BDSM? Excellent, we can always do with
  an extra helping hand (or two). If you're not a great coder, we always
  appreciate people helping out in the channel and giving support. If you
  are interested in coding, there are a few things you'll need to know and
  a few things that make the process in general a lot smoother.

%p
  We also greatly appreciate documentation patches, submitted from the rvm-site repository.

%h2 General Guidelines

%ol
  %li
    When contributing, either keep patches simple or work on a topic branch - this
    makes it easier for us to merge in discrete changes and means you always keep
    things seperate where needed.
  %li
    The code has to be compatible with bash and takes and almost git-like design architecturally.
    Many actions (e.g. aliases) simply call out to a script in the ~/.rvm/scripts
    directory. For an example of the new, simplified style of coding these make
    sure you check out:
    %ul
      %li scripts/snapshot
      %li scripts/repair
      %li scripts/tools
  %li
    Clean code is preferred - if in doubt, take a look back and refactor.
  %li
    Drop into the IRC room (#rvm on freenode) and chat to wayneeseguin if you have a task
    in mind. You may find someone else has already started on it.

%h2 Handy Tips

%ol
  %li
    When you need to test out something on a fresh install, it's simple
    enough to just move the .rvm folder out of the way, install a new copy
    and to then move your old copy back when you're finished.
  %li
    Generally, working in a clone of the repository is by far the best way
    to go and from there it is simple to update your main install / ~/.rvm.
    All you need to do is change to the root directory for it (e.g. ~/Code/rvm),
    and run:
    = sh_cmd "./install"
  %li
    It helps to use bash as your primary shell but for some features you'll
    want to have zsh installed as well to ensure compatibility.
